# Altschool Project Title: Payment Checkout Page
## Overview
This project involves the development of a mobile and tablet responsive payment checkout page based on the provided Figma design. The implementation is done using HTML and CSS, incorporating various techniques and features to enhance the user interface.

## Key Features and Techniques
### 1. Mobile
The payment checkout page is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience on both mobile and tablet devices. This was achieved through careful consideration of layout and styling for different screen sizes.

### 2. ATTRIBUTE Selector Usage
The ATTRIBUTE selector was employed to target specific HTML elements, enhancing the overall structure and appearance of the checkout page. This selector provides a powerful way to select and style elements based on their attributes, contributing to a more dynamic and flexible design.

### 3. Utilizing border-bottom over underline
The project emphasizes the use of the border-bottom CSS property instead of the traditional underline property. This decision was made to offer more control over the styling of underlined elements, allowing for customization of the line's thickness, color, and other properties.

### 4. Styling Placeholder Text
The styling of placeholder text was explored to improve the visual aesthetics of form fields. Techniques such as color adjustments, font styling, and size modifications were implemented to create an appealing and cohesive design.

### 5. In-Depth Exploration of Flexbox
The project delves into the deeper aspects of flexbox, a powerful CSS layout model. Flexbox was used extensively to create flexible and efficient page layouts, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

### 6. SVG Integration
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) elements were incorporated into the design, enhancing visual appeal and allowing for crisp and scalable graphics. This approach contributes to a modern and professional appearance for the payment checkout page.

### 7. Manipulating Placeholders
The project includes creative techniques for manipulating placeholders to improve the overall user experience. Placeholder text is styled to provide subtle hints and guidance, enhancing the clarity of form fields.

### 8. Checkbox Styling
Thanks to insights from ChatGPT, the checkboxes on the payment checkout page were styled effectively. This includes customization of checkbox appearance, ensuring a cohesive design that aligns with the overall aesthetic of the page.

Conclusion
The payment checkout page project showcases a comprehensive exploration of HTML and CSS techniques to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. The implementation of advanced features such as ATTRIBUTE selectors, border-bottom styling, flexbox layouts, SVG integration, and creative placeholder manipulation contributes to a polished and professional checkout experience.
